Today I went to second turtle patrol, we went to a private resort zone, but still didn't see any turtle. I think these beaches are overexploited. There are so many beach chairs, constructions, hotels and human.

Luckily, we saw a group of crabs, many group of little fish and a manta? But I don't think I will go to the turtal patrol again. I want to see turtles, maybe in anohter area.
