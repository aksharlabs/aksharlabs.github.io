It is a random thing. In the afternoon, I feel like I need a break, between fish market and Jebel Haffet Mountain in Al Ain, I choose I will go to Jebel Haffet Mountain, 150km away. I started around 3:30 pm.

It was my first time to drive such a long way. It was crazy, the maximum speed is 160km/h in the high way. I drove very carefully. I finally reach the top of mountain around 6:30, and I had the beautiful view of the city from there.

I didn't stay long, I thought there was hiking places, but no, you just drove all the way up the topmost. The road is very nice, but there were a lot of very sharpe turns. The most craziest thing in Al Ain is the roundabout. You have to wait the roundabout is clear before you enter the roundabout and turn the left light on. Be careful! Please, Wait! The coming car from the roundabout will leave the roundabout in any time, and you may hit it if you enter the roundabout.

I stayed in Ayla Hotel, first time staying in a hotel in UAE. Not bad. Free access to an indoor swimming poor, hot tub, steam house and a sauna house. After getting out of the steam house, on the right, there is a cafe called Sky I think. There is the best view of the night, it is neer the Grade Mosque in Al Ain.
There are a lot of people smoking Shisha (water pipe) there to. The food is not very good (I ordered beef burger), but the view is the best. And not very expesive.

The next day, you can have a very nice brunch in the hotel, with 55 dh.

The next, I decided to go back, if I went to some places and I would get very tired. I a little bit afraid of driving on the highway. But I decided to drop by a lake in the desert on the way back.

The lake is called Al Wathbah lack, there are some resorts, palaces, horses, camels. Good desert view and some trees in the desert.
